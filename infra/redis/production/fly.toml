# Redis Cache - Production Configuration
# Language Quiz Service
#
# IMPORTANT: This must run as a SINGLE INSTANCE
# Multiple Redis instances do not share state - the app loads caches at startup
# into whichever Redis it connects to. Multiple instances = cache inconsistency.
# 
# To verify single instance: flyctl machines list --app language-quiz-redis-production
# If more than one exists, destroy extras: flyctl machines destroy <id> --force
